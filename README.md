# Radio V:
Radio V is a simulation of fictional (from games) and real life radio stations each with their own themes and music. Radio V is currently in BETA stage so bugs may still exist as well as many features are yet to be added, changed, or improved.

# How to install Radio V:
1. Download the latest version of Radio V from: https://github.com/Nuzza/Radio-V/releases
2. Extract the folder and run Radio V.exe
3. If you get a message saying 'Windows protected your PC', click "More info' and 'Run anyway'. This message will only show once. Radio V should then launch.
